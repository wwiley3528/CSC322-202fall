      <h1>Welcome To Wiley's World</h1>

      <p>
        Hello world, my name is William Wiley.<br />
        I'm a Sr IT Technician for Derby City Gaming. I served in the US Army
        for 12 years.<br />
        My spare time consist of being a professional photographer, custom
        sneaker painter, working out and podcasting.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I mention, I am a podcaster. I co-host a podcast called Aries Talkin
        Sportz.<br />
        My co-host, Reg, and I came up with the idea due to us not talking about
        sports on our seperate podcast<br />
        The name of our podcast is due to the fact that we are both Aries, we
        actually share the same birthday.
      </p>

      <p>
        I appreciate my military career, because I was able to travel and see
        sights that I could never imagine.<br />
        To be able to join at the age of 17, opened up a whole new world to me
        since I am from a small town in Alabama.<br />
        I enjoy working out and a good bourbon or margarita. I'm am set to
        graduate with my Bachelors degree in the Spring.<br />
      </p>
