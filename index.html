      <h1>Welcome To Wiley's World</h1>

      <p>
        Hello world, my name is William Wiley.<br />
        I'm a Sr IT Technician for Derby City Gaming. I served in the US Army
        for 12 years.<br />
        My spare time consists of being a professional photographer, custom
        sneaker painter, working out and podcasting.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I mention, I am a podcaster. I co-host a podcast called
        <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aries-talkin-sportz/id1585708294">Aries Talkin Sportz</a>. My co-host, Reg, and I came up with
        the idea due to us not talking about sports on our separate podcasts.
        The name of our podcast is due to the fact that we are both Aries, we
        actually share the same birthday.
      </p>

      <p>
        I appreciate my military career, because I was able to travel and see
        sights that I could never imagine. To be able to join at the age of 17,
        opened up a whole new world to me since I am from a small town in
        Alabama. I enjoy working out and a good bourbon or margarita. I'm am set
        to graduate with my Bachelors degree in the Spring.<br />
      </p>
