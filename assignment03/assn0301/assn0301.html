                      The shoes had been there for as long as anyone could remember. In fact, it was difficult for anyone to come up with a date they had first appeared.
                      It had seemed they'd always been there and yet they seemed so out of place. Why nobody had removed them was a question that had been asked time and again,
                      but while they all thought it, nobody had ever found the energy to actually do it.
                      So, the shoes remained on the steps, out of place in one sense, but perfectly normal in another.

                      There are different types of secrets. She had held onto plenty of them during her life, but this one was different.
                      She found herself holding onto the worst type. It was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didn't tell someone about it,
                      but it could end up getting you killed if you did.
